# TradeTogether v0.12.0-strpm-inventory

STR Plugin Messaging edition of TradeTogether for Skyrim Together Reborn.

## Requirements

- Skyrim Special Edition / Anniversary Edition
- SKSE
- Skyrim Together Reborn
- STR Plugin Messaging API **0.11.0 inventory-service build** with Proxy Resolver and Inventory Bridge support
- The same TradeTogether build on every player
- SkyUI for the optional MCM

TradeTogether itself opens no UDP socket and requires no TradeTogether-specific port forwarding.

## Trade flow

1. Both players connect through Skyrim Together Reborn.
2. Target the other player's character and press the configured **Trade / Validate** key (default: T).
3. The target receives an **Accept / Decline** MessageBox.
4. Both players compose their offer in their personal inventory.
5. Add or remove items and gold using the configured controls.
6. Press **Trade / Validate** to review the offers.
7. Both players receive the Ready / Modify and final Confirm / Modify prompts.
8. After both confirmations, TradeTogether performs the automatic native transfer.

Quest items are rejected. Item-only, gold-only, mixed item/gold trades and one-way gifts are supported.

## v0.11.0 — configurable controls and SkyUI MCM

v0.11.0 moves all TradeTogether controls out of hard-coded input constants.

The following actions are configurable:

- Trade / Validate
- Add selected item
- Remove selected item
- Add gold
- Remove gold
- Cancel trade

Defaults remain:

```text
Trade / Validate     T
Add selected item    Insert
Remove selected item Delete
Add gold             Numpad +
Remove gold          Numpad -
Cancel trade         Tab
```

Users without a numpad can map **Add Gold** and **Remove Gold** to normal keyboard keys.

The current Shift/Ctrl amount modifiers are preserved:

```text
Shift + Gold key = x10
Ctrl + Gold key  = x100
```

### INI storage

Bindings are persisted in:

```text
Data\SKSE\Plugins\TradeTogether.ini
```

```ini
[Controls]
TradeKey=20
AddItemKey=210
RemoveItemKey=211
GoldAddKey=78
GoldRemoveKey=74
CancelKey=15
```

The values are DirectInput / SkyUI keymap scan codes.

### Runtime MCM bridge

The SKSE plugin exports a small Papyrus API through `TradeTogetherNative`.

When a key is changed in the MCM:

1. the new scan code is written to `TradeTogether.ini`;
2. `InputEventSink` reloads the bindings immediately;
3. no Skyrim restart or save reload is required.

A **Reset all key bindings** MCM action restores the original defaults.

MCM Helper is not required. The menu uses SkyUI's normal `SKI_ConfigBase` API.

Papyrus sources:

```

```

## Numpad compatibility

The historical numpad + / - bindings need a special Win32 input path because SkyUI's InventoryMenu does not consistently expose those keys as normal `ButtonEvent`s.

v0.11.0 keeps that proven fallback only when the gold actions are still mapped to their default numpad keys.

If the user selects any other key in the MCM, TradeTogether uses the normal Skyrim/SKSE keyboard event stream instead.

## Connected-player target validation

TradeTogether uses STRPM's Proxy Resolver to map connected STR `ConnectionID`s to local Skyrim proxy FormIDs. Normal NPCs are rejected, while real STR proxies are sent through `TargetKind::kPlayer`.

## Deferred STRPM receive path

Incoming STRPM callbacks only copy messages into a preallocated queue. Parsing, logging and gameplay work happen afterwards outside the transport callback.

## Skyrim Souls RE compatible MessageBoxes

TradeTogether preserves native `MessageBoxData` defaults and does not force `MessageBoxMenu` pause flags.

With Skyrim Souls RE, this configuration remains supported:

```ini
[UNPAUSED_MENUS]
bMessageBoxMenu = true
```

TradeTogether hotkeys are suspended while `MessageBoxMenu` is open so an input intended for an unpaused MessageBox cannot also trigger a trade action in the background.

The complete v0.10.0 trade flow was validated with Skyrim Souls RE and unpaused MessageBoxes.

## STRPM Inventory Bridge transfer

v0.12.0 no longer transfers inventory by calling Skyrim `RemoveItem` on the remote STR proxy and never reconstructs or passes an `ExtraDataList`.

At final confirmation TradeTogether:

1. requests STRPM's canonical local inventory snapshot;
2. resolves the partner's STR `ConnectionID`;
3. converts each offered line to the matching portable `InventoryEntry`;
4. starts an owner-to-owner STRPM inventory transfer;
5. logs the asynchronous `Prepared / RemovingLocal / Committing / ApplyingRemote / Complete / Failed / RolledBack` states.

Gold is transferred through the same Inventory Bridge path.

The current bridge API does not expose Skyrim display names for individual canonical variants. For safety, this first integration rejects a trade line when the same base FormID has several distinct STRPM inventory variants. It will not guess which tempered, enchanted, charged, poisoned or otherwise modified instance the user intended to trade.

## STR Plugin Messaging transport

Channel:

```text
tradetogether.offer.v1
```

Messages use reliable + ordered delivery.

## Diagnostics

Log:

```text
Documents/My Games/Skyrim Special Edition/SKSE/TradeTogether.log
```

Expected v0.11.0 startup entries include:

```text
TradeTogether v0.11.0-strpm loading
TradeTogether Papyrus MCM bridge registered
TradeTogether controls loaded: trade=... add=... remove=... goldAdd=... goldRemove=... cancel=...
TradeTogether STRPM deferred receive dispatcher started
TradeTogether v0.11.0-strpm ready ... network=ready
```

Changing a key through the MCM should log:

```text
MCM key mapping updated: action=GoldAdd key=0x...
TradeTogether controls loaded: ...
```

## Current status

`v0.12.0-strpm-inventory` is the experimental integration branch for STRPM 0.11.0's Inventory Bridge.

The old direct `ExtraDataList` / remote-proxy transfer path has been removed from `AutoTransfer`. Inventory validation and transfer now go through STRPM's canonical inventory representation.

This build still needs compilation and two-client runtime validation. In particular, verify simple stacks and gold first, then instance-bearing items. The bridge itself is still considered experimental until those tests pass.
